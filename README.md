# LunoOS-Main

## DISCLAIMER: OS is still under early development

## Development Update (11.08.2025):
  - Successfully implemented Live-user (luno-live) for:
      - Autologin into KDE Plasma 6.x
      - Main installation process

  - Every following commit will go to an extra branch, which you should **not** use for building     the ISO!
      - If the changes there are in a stable state, they will be merged into the main branch

# ToDo-List:
  - Make a (flexible) installer with either bash or python
  - Include the option for a customized kernel during setup
